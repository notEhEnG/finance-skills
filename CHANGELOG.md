# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Evidence renders as a table.** Single-ticker draft evidence is now a
  `Metric | Value | Read` markdown table (flags stay as bullets beneath) —
  numbers scan in two seconds instead of hiding in bullet prose. The evidence
  block is joined with single newlines so tables survive the draft's
  blank-line paragraph join. SKILL.md §4a and agent-policy gain the formatting
  rule: **numbers live in tables, argument lives in prose** — the agent must
  keep the table in its synthesis, and compare answers must keep the
  side-by-side per-ticker table.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Synthesis eval tier.** `agent_eval.synthesis_checks` scores the analyst-layer
  contract: `courier_verbatim_draft` (reply is `answer_draft` pasted, similarity
  ≥ 0.90), missing conditional-thesis / weighed-tension / watch-item language
  (§4a structure), and `insufficient_report_evidence` — the automated
  **ticker-swap proxy** (< 2 report-specific figures = generic answer).
  `score_answer` now grades three axes: safe → useful → synthesized.
  `docs/eval.md` documents the tier plus the manual ticker-swap protocol and a
  per-agent publishing table.
- **README: competitor-class comparison** — prompt-only skills, web-search
  analysts, and API wrappers vs. this skill's fact-layer + analyst-layer split.

### Fixed
- `agent_eval.score_answer` no longer forwards `intent`/`status` kwargs into
  `hard_fail_checks` (previously a latent `TypeError` for any caller passing
  them).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- **Agent contract: fact layer → analyst layer.** `answer_draft` is now the
  *evidence floor*, not the final reply: agents must write their own synthesis on
  top of the report (weigh conflicting signals, connect flags to consequences,
  state what would change the picture), with all numbers still traceable to the
  engine report. `SKILL.md` §0 rewritten; new §4a **conditional-thesis** shape for
  "is X a buy?" questions (setup → bull case → bear case → conditional screen →
  what to watch → boundary), including the ticker-swap self-check.
- **`next_action` renamed** `respond_with_answer_draft` → `respond_with_synthesis`;
  `agent_instructions` first entry now mandates analyst synthesis instead of
  paste-with-polish. Guardrails unchanged (no invented numbers, no unconditional
  buy/sell/hold, fixture/disabled disclosures must survive).
- `docs/agent-policy.md` success/failure criteria updated: pasting `answer_draft`
  verbatim is now an explicit failure mode ("courier behavior, not analysis").
- README: new positioning — deterministic engine for numbers, the agent
  (Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity) for the argument.

### Fixed
- **`install.sh` no longer recursively copies prior installs.** Skill-install
  directories (`.claude`, `.antigravity`, `.codex`) and build artifacts (`dist`,
  `build`, `*.egg-info`, venvs) are excluded from the copied skill payload; a
  stale install could previously nest a full repo copy inside itself.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **`ask` no longer masks errors.** The `--explain` builder call now feature-detects
  a `flags` kwarg instead of a catch-and-retry `except TypeError`, so a genuine
  `TypeError` inside a builder surfaces instead of being silently swallowed.
- **`ask` unexpected exceptions are debuggable.** The catch-all now prints a
  traceback to stderr and tags the draft with the exception type, so a code bug is
  distinguishable from a legitimate "data unavailable".
- **`doctor` import guarded.** `load_fixture` now uses the `finance_skills.data` /
  `data` `__package__` guard like the rest of the module, instead of relying on
  sibling-module `sys.path` pollution when installed.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Scannable table + emoji output** for multi-ticker views: `compare` and
  `watchlist run compare|rank` render a bold **Metric** header with 🏆 per-row
  leaders; `screen` highlights per-field leaders — faster to eyeball the contrast.

### Fixed
- Lint/type hygiene: drop an unnecessary list comprehension (`screen`) and unused
  `type: ignore` comments (`ask`); ignore the `.antigravity/` skill-install copy.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`ask` one-shot path** (`scripts/ask.py`, `finance-skills ask "…"`): route → engine → **`answer_draft`**.
- **`answer_draft` builder** (`scripts/answer_draft.py`) — deterministic user-facing analysis so agents stop dumping JSON.
- **`doctor`** — version mismatch (skill scripts vs site-packages), yfinance, fixture smoke.
- **Usefulness checks** in `agent_eval` (empty / caveat-wall answers fail soft quality).
- SKILL.md **happy path**: one command, `stop_tool_loop`, send draft.

### Changed
- Agent contract prioritizes **answering the user** over multi-script ceremony.
- Help text advertises `ask` / `doctor` first.

### Fixed
- Lowercase tickers in NL (`is nbis a buy?`) route without false clarification (0.6.x follow-on).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Hard agent gate** in SKILL: no numbers without `route --json` + engine `--json` this turn.
- **`engine_report` on all core JSON verbs** (brief, valuation, redflags, health, company, analyze).
- **Public eval** `docs/eval.md` (20 prompts) + **transcript hard-fail** tests (`agent_eval`, `test_agent_transcripts`).
- **Demo GIF** `docs/demo.gif` (route → fixture → no-buy answer).
- **`docs/SOCIAL.md`** — post to agent/Claude communities, not investing subs.

### Changed
- README sells the **agent contract** first; data-quality (yfinance / 10-K) before demos.
- MCP described as **not shipped** (no vibe claims).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-07-11

### Added (agent middleware P0–P2)
- **Strict agent contract** in `SKILL.md` + `docs/agent-policy.md` (activation,
  sole-source evidence, response order, refuse personal advice, untrusted data).
- **`route_request()`** + `finance-skills route --json` machine-readable routing
  (`intent`, tickers, secondary_intents, refuse, learn, clarification).
- **Canonical EngineReport envelope** (`scripts/report_schema.py`,
  `docs/engine-report.schema.json`) attached to brief `--json` as `engine_report`.
- Routing table tests (40+) and schema/projection tests.
- Agent threat model section in `SECURITY.md`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- **README rewritten as “AI agent financial skill”** — problem-first hero, vs ChatGPT /
  vs MCP, real fail-closed sample, agent-oriented install. Discoverability positioning
  for Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / AI engineers (not investors).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- **README rewrite** — focused landing page: one hero path, compact command table,
  single fixture example (brief/CRWV), short architecture. Removed outdated multi-page
  dumps, ghost-verb help sample, and per-test inventory (details stay in `SKILL.md` /
  `CHANGELOG`).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Investor personas** on brief: `--style=value|growth|quality|risk` (same facts, different emphasis).
- **`--explain`**: plain-language “why this matters” for computed metrics (`explain.py`).
- **Precise missing-data diagnostics** + **filing verification checklist** on brief (`diagnostics.py`).
- **DCF scenarios** when inputs allow: bear/base/bull growth, discount-rate and FCF-conversion sensitivity (`metrics.dcf_scenarios`).
- **Peer presets** for compare: `--preset=saas|ai-infra|semiconductor|megacap` (`peers.py`); `compare list-presets`.
- **Ranking summary** on screen, compare, and `watchlist run rank` (`rank.py`).
- Shared presentation (`format.py`) and CLI plumbing (`cli.py`, `run_single_ticker`, `load_for_cli` everywhere).
- Single verb **builder registry** (`Verb.builder` → export/watchlist); co-located module dispatch.

### Changed
- `build_report` always returns a structured dict; text via `format_report` (no dual return type).
- Skill-path imports use `if __package__` so a stale site-packages install cannot shadow scripts/.
- Company **Risks** section uses `redflags.flags_for` (one policy).

### Fixed
- **DCF fail-closed on unknown net debt** (no more `net_debt or 0.0`); skip reasons name exact missing inputs (FCF, shares, debt/cash).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`brief` — default answer-shaped stack** (`scripts/brief.py`): identity →
  regime/Rule of 40 → valuation → solvency → top red flags → `gaps[]` →
  disclaimer. Text + `--json` for agents.
- **Single verb registry** (`VERBS` in `router.py`) drives help, Core/Lens,
  and CLI dispatch. `route()` **always** returns a verb (default `brief`).
- **CLI dispatch**: `finance-skills brief NBIS`, bare `finance-skills NBIS`,
  and `finance-skills semiconductor CRWV` run real modules (not resolve-only).
- `redflags.flags_for(report, limit=…)` — public, severity-sorted; brief uses it.
- `data.normalize_ticker` / `load_for_cli` — shared CLI ticker boundary.

### Fixed
- **CLI verb-typo dispatch.** A mistyped verb with a ticker (`valuatoin NBIS`)
  was treated as a ticker and the real ticker dropped; a fuzzy verb now wins over
  the ticker fallback only when a later argument looks like the ticker.
- **Path traversal on the cache write surface.** A ticker like `../evil` was
  interpolated into a cache filename and could write outside the cache directory.
  Tickers are now validated at the IO boundary (`_normalize_ticker`) and
  `_cache_path` refuses any path resolving outside `CACHE_DIR`. Regression-tested.

### Changed
- Help / CANONICAL trimmed: removed unbuilt verbs (`rank`, `portfolio`, `news`,
  `earnings`, bare banking/REIT/… engines). Agent contract is answer-first +
  fail-closed guided gaps (see `SKILL.md`).

### Added (OSS hardening)
- Continuous integration (GitHub Actions): pytest matrix on Python 3.10–3.13,
  ruff lint, mypy type-check, and a build + install smoke test.
- `SECURITY.md` and `tests/test_safety.py` that **enforce** the read-only
  architecture as AST invariants (not keyword scans): one network boundary
  (`data.py` only), no brokerage/trading SDK import anywhere, and no
  `eval`/`exec`/`subprocess`/`os.system`.
- Adversarial tests for the `screen` rule parser; the parser now validates the
  whole rule up front (fail-closed) so a valid prefix can't mask a hostile clause.
- Offline tests for the `data.py` IO shell (cache, coercion, fixture fallback),
  lifting the security-surface module from ~52% to ~73% coverage; coverage floor
  raised to 80% (total ~82%).
- Community health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue/PR
  templates, and a `dependabot.yml`.
- `ruff` + `mypy` + coverage configuration; a coverage floor in CI.
- Trusted-publishing release workflow (PyPI OIDC — no stored token).
- `[dev]` optional-dependency group.

### Changed (OSS hardening)
- **Minimum Python is now 3.10** (was 3.9). Python 3.9 reached end-of-life in
  October 2025 and no longer receives security fixes; dropping it lets CI, ruff's
  target, and mypy's checked version all agree on one supported floor. This is a
  deliberate, consumer-visible support change — pin `finance-skills<0.4` if you
  are still on 3.9.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Keyword routing: a `KEYWORDS` phrase→verb map and `router.py route` subcommand
  so plain-English questions resolve to a verb deterministically.
- New engine views: `redflags`, `health`, `compare`.
- Power tools: `screen` (safe `field op value` rule language), `watchlist`, `export`.
- PyPI packaging: `scripts/` installs as the importable `finance_skills` package
  with a `finance-skills` console entry point; first release on PyPI.

## [0.2.1] - and earlier

- Verb-first CLI over the shared engine; segment-aware Rule of 40; DCF; EV/EBITDA;
  fail-closed net-debt handling; offline fixtures and tests. See the git history.
